		<h1>What Is Promenade?</h1>

		<p>Promenade is an iPad app designed for family members and caregivers to use when visiting loved ones living with dementia or related illnesses. Created by experts in the field of Gerontology and Therapeutic Recreation, Promenade is a tool that can help stimulate conversation, encourage reminiscence, and make personal visits more rewarding and engaging. Promenade presents groups of photographs based on user selected topics; however, it's much more than just an image search. Every topic is accompanied by a list of conversation based questions, as well as related topic suggestions to ensure there’s always something to talk about. Conversations will flow with ease as you and your loved one nostalgically discuss memories inspired by the countless photos and questions provided. Bring Promenade along for your next visit, and revisit a lifetime of memories, together.</p>

		<h1>How Does It Help?</h1>

		<p>Promenade provides an alternative approach to communicating with loved ones living with dementia. In view of the proven positive effects of Reminiscence Therapy, Promenade uses photos and conversation-based questions in a way that makes it easier for someone with dementia to reminisce about past life events and pleasant memories. The photos provide the visual cue needed to help trigger the memory, and the questions provide an opportunity for the visiting family member to help expand on that memory and discuss the details surrounding it. Struggling to understand and converse with those we love is a reality that many of us face on a daily basis. With Promenade, both loved ones and their family members can enjoy visits again. </p>

		<h1>What is Reminiscence Therapy?</h1>

		<p>Reminiscence therapy is the heart and soul of Promenade. Reminiscence therapy is a way of thinking back on past activities, events and experiences. It’s a powerful therapeutic approach that often improves mood and brings a person back to a reality they know and more importantly, understand. When living with dementia, less and less of one’s current surroundings make sense. With a dissipating short-term memory, feelings such as confusion, mistrust and anxiety are unfortunately all too common. Through reminiscing, a person with dementia can take pleasure in reviewing positive stories and events from days gone by. Use Promenade’s photos, questions and music to enhance your reminiscing experience.</p>

			<center><h2>Validation Therapy</h2></center>
			<p>Validation therapy is a means through which we accept and support another’s version of ‘reality’. When an individual with dementia begins to lose their short term memory, they often leave the present reality, and revert back to a different time and place. This time and place usually coincides with their past. Your loved one may feel as if he or she is back on the farm, or getting ready for school rather than lying in bed at a Long Term Care Facility. When using Promenade, it is essential not to “correct” your loved one’s reality, but rather, to enter their reality with compassion and understanding. Accepting the reality of the person with dementia not only decreases feelings of anxiety, but also opens up a new world of opportunity for meaningful connection and conversation.</p>

		<h1>Always Improving</h1>
		<p>Promenade tries its best to find relevant questions whenever you use the custom search option. If the questions don't match your desired search term, try rephrasing it. Occasionally you'll get of a list questions that don't match - we know this happens from time to time, and while it'll never be 100%, we're constantly working on making it better! Help us out by letting us know what custom search questions we're missing.</p>
